Folder cloud_backend is also referred to as the backend, or services.
Folder aura_portal is also referred to as the frontend, or the portal.
Folder #Utils has no weight at all as far as the project is concerned. Simply utils for day to day stuff.

Frontend and backend do not share any code. IE: Permissions, models, DTO's, etc... must exist both sides.

Portal DTO's: Preference is records over classes.
